# Python Class
Notebooks and homeworks from a five week set of lessons in Python.  Much of it taken from other lectures on the web.  Everything is meant to be run in Jupyter (links below for installing) with the robotpy libraries installed.  **HOWEVER**, since git is jupyter-aware, you can just browse the notebooks in the directories here for quick checks, and even run them in the cloud with google colaboratory.

### Contents
* folders are organized by week, and homeworks are being added 
  * week one
    * python_intro_basics.ipynb - a super-quick intro to python using Jupyter (requires Jupyter)
    * advanced_concepts.ipynb  - so far: lambdas, args, kwargs
  * week two
    * classes
	* numpy for imaging
	* openCV and object tracking
  * week three
    * TBD
  * week four
    *  TBD   
* week five 
     * TBD

Clone the git and install on your own machine:
Use "git clone https://github.com/aesatchien/FRC_training.git" from the git bash (or any git aware) shell to download.  If you don't have git and you just want to look at the code, you can download the repository from the links on the right as a zip file.

### Additional resources  
Just using Jupyter desktop as an all-in one for mac or windows:
