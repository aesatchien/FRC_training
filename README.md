# FRC_training
Notebooks and how-tos for python and robotpy

Clone the git and install on your own machine:
Use "git clone https://github.com/aesatchien/FRC_training.git" from the git bash (or any git aware) shell to download.  If you don't have git and you just want to look at the code, you can download the repository from the links on the right as a zip file.  Everything is meant to be run in Jupyter (links below for installing) with the robotpy libraries installed.

### Contents
* notebooks - Jupyter notebooks 
  * python_tutorials
    * python_intro_basics.ipynb - a super-quick intro to python using Jupyter (requires Jupyter)
    * advanced_concepts.ipynb  - so far: lambdas, args, kwargs
  * homeworks
    * hints on assignments (currently has hints on autonomous movement commands)
  * controls
    * PID controllers, odometry
  * robot_code
    *  binding_commands - hints on how to get commands linked to robot actions
    *  robot_examples - more hints on commands V1 and V2 frameworks for the robot/subsystem/command approach to programming an FRC bot
